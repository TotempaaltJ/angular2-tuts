## Some opinions
* Nobody has explained what the `[()]` thing is yet. I'm assuming it's two-way
  binding and each of the types of parentheses stands for one direction?
* I'm very much not okay with the way they embed the styles and templates
  within the Javascript code. I know there's better ways to do that, but they
  should be promoting those.
* Two-way binding is kinda cool, I guess. It gets rid of a whole bunch of
  useless boilerplate-y code of updating data based on models. That's pretty
  sweet.
